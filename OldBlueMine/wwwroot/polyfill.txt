In the JavaScript world, one frequently hears the words shim and polyfill.
What are those things and what is the difference between them?

Shim. A shim is a library that brings a new API to an older environment,
using only the means of that environment.

Polyfill.
A polyfill is a piece of code (usually JavaScript on the Web)
used to provide modern functionality on older browsers that do not natively support it.
Thus, a polyfill is a browser-related shim.

In October 2010, Remy Sharp blogged about the term “polyfill” [via Rick Waldron]:
Polyfilla is a UK product known as Spackling Paste in the US.
With that in mind: think of the browsers as a wall with cracks in it.
These [polyfills] help smooth out the cracks and give us
a nice smooth wall of browsers to work with.

Heimdall stood guard over Asgard, the home of the gods.
He lived near Bifrost, the rainbow bridge that connected Asgard
to the world of humans and from there kept watch for the approach of the giants,
who were the enemies of the gods.
